    "Hello all! I hope everyone has been enjoying the course and learning a lot! This week, you will be learning about unsupervised learning. While supervised learning algorithms need labeled examples (x,y), unsupervised learning algorithms need only the input (x). You will learn about clusteringâ€”which is used for market segmentation, text summarization, among many other applications.\n",
