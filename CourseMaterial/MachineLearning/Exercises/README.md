The exercises are modified versions of those implemented by [Gerges Dib](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments). To solve the exercises, download the [zip file](CourseMaterial/MachineLearning/Exercises/AllExercisesForDownload.zip) containing all Jupyter Notebooks. Then unpack the zipfile, launch Jupyter Notebook through Anaconda, and begin implementing your solutions. 

NOTE: If you are following the course via Coursera, and aiming to obtain a certificate, you should use the original exercises by [Gerges Dib](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments). These contain grading and submission cells which can be used to upload your results to Coursera.
