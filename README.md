# Overview
The course is centered around Machine Learning by Andrew Ng and cs231n (deep learning) from Stanford University. Additionally, resources are available for statistical learning, if a more theoretical approach is desired, compared to Andrew Ng's course.

Everything below is free and ready to follow. The curriculum below provides an introduction to machine learning and deep learning for a 5 ECTS points Master's level course. 

If you want a good introduction to neural networks to get an overview, go watch 3Blue1Browns (Grant Sanderson) neural networks introduction [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)

Following this course, dig into object oriented programming, and you should be good.


# Installing our Python environment
1) Install Anaconda with Python 3.7. The installer can be downloaded here:  https://www.anaconda.com/downloadâ€‹ . It will at some point ask if you want to 'Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable'. The answer to this question is 'no', you do not want to do this.

2) Launch a Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda (use the Anaconda Navigator if you use Windows/Mac or create and run it from a new conda environment if you use Linux).

3) Write and run the following code: print("Hello, World!")

4) Assuming that the computer is having a good day, you should see the words "Hello, World!" being printed. If this is not the case, or you never even made it to step 4, then do not worry. Take a deep breath and a sip of your coffee. Search for solutions online and try one more time. 

Using Anaconda should be seen as a suggestion for newcomers in the field. If you already have another solution running, such as using Docker containers, you are welcome to continue in this way.
