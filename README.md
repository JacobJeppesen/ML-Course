### For PhD students:
During my PhD we were allowed to follow one of the courses and do a project based on it for our own research to obtain 5 ECTS points as part of the required

# Installing our Python environment
1) Install Anaconda with Python 3.7. The installer can be downloaded here:  https://www.anaconda.com/downloadâ€‹ . It will at some point ask if you want to 'Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable'. The answer to this question is 'no', you do not want to do this.

2) Launch a Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda (use the Anaconda Navigator if you use Windows/Mac or create and run it from a new conda environment if you use Linux).

3) Write and run the following code: print("Hello, World!")

4) Assuming that the computer is having a good day, you should see the words "Hello, World!" being printed. If this is not the case, or you never even made it to step 4, then do not worry. Take a deep breath and a sip of your coffee. Search for solutions online and try one more time. 

Using Anaconda should be seen as a suggestion for newcomers in the field. If you already have another solution running, such as using Docker containers, you are welcome to continue in this way.
