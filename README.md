# Overview
This repository is a collection of open material to learn machine learning. The curriculum below is designed to match a 5 ECTS point course for Master's level students. It is a combination of lectures and exercises from two courses, namely [_Machine Learning_ by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and [_CS231N: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition_ from Stanford University](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/). All exercises are to be solved by downloading them to your local computer and solve them using Jupyter Notebook. The curriculum is designed to cover important aspects of the possiblities when applying machine learning, with plenty of opportunities for students to expand their understanding by following each of the online courses in their full extent. For the interested, additional resources are available for a recommended full course on [_Statistical Learning_ by Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani](https://www.r-bloggers.com/in-depth-introduction-to-machine-learning-in-15-hours-of-expert-videos/). 

If you would like a brief introduction to machine learning, watch 3Blue1Brown's (Grant Sanderson's) [introduction to neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi).

The [ML_in_research](ML_in_research/) folder contains references for novel research within the natural sciences employing deep learning.

# Installing the Python environment
1) Install Anaconda with Python 3.7. The installer can be downloaded here:  https://www.anaconda.com/download​ . It will at some point ask if you want to 'Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable'. The answer to this question is 'no', you do not want to do this.

2) Launch a Jupyter Notebook in Anaconda (use the Anaconda Navigator if you use Windows/Mac or create and run it from a new conda environment if you use Linux).

3) Write and run the following code: print("Hello, World!")

4) Assuming that the computer is having a good day, you should see the words "Hello, World!" being printed. If this is not the case, or you never even made it to step 4, then do not worry. Take a deep breath and a sip of your coffee. Search for solutions online and try one more time. 

Using Anaconda should be seen as a suggestion for newcomers in the field. If you already have another solution running, such as using Docker containers, you are welcome to continue in this way.
